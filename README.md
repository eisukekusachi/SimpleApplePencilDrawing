It is a simple drawing app for Apple Pencil. I extracted the drawing functionality from <a href="https://github.com/eisukekusachi/HandDrawingSwiftMetal">this repo</a>. This is a drawing app with various features such as layers and undo. And I want to improve the drawing functionality of the app, but it has become large and complex. To make it easier to understand, I have extracted only the drawing functionality.

I want to improve the drawing functionality. I would appreciate any suggestions for improvements!
