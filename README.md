This is a simple drawing app designed for the Apple Pencil. The drawing functionality has been extracted from <a href="https://github.com/eisukekusachi/HandDrawingSwiftMetal">this repo</a>, which had become large due to additional features such as layers and an undo function. By isolating and simplifying the core drawing features, it is easier to understand and improve.

I am looking to enhance the drawing functionality further. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions for improvements!
